bio: | 
  
  I am a graduate student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) pursuing a Master's of Science in Computer Vision. I completed my undergraduate degree at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/), completing two degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am fortunate to have worked with [Professor Donglai Wei](https://donglaiw.github.io/) in the BC Computer Vision Lab, focusing primarily on solving segmentation tasks in support of the natural sciences.
